Just my notes about vimgrep, nothing new that isn't better documented elsewhere.

{% highlight console %}
  :vimgrep /pattern/gj ../**/*
{% endhighlight %}

**'g'** means find all matches, not just one per line.  
**'j'** means don't automatically go to the first match.  
`'../**/*'` can be refined, this search will search a whole project recursively from the 'pwd'  

After running the search, you can open the results by:

{% highlight console %}
  :cl or :cw 
{% endhighlight %}

**':cl'** opens the quickfix list as a local window, so you can select a result and then it closes.  
**':cw'** opens the quickfix list as a shared window so you can navicate it using 'hkjl' and select by 'enter'.  
**':cn'** and **':cp'** also navigate (next, previous).  
**':ccl'** Closes the quickfix window.
