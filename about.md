Software Engineer at DigitalGlobe.

### More Information

I am a polyglot developer, but I am most productive with Ruby. I am just as comfortable with Ruby both in and outside of Rails and have developed many applications outside of the standard Ruby web stack.

<br>

I believe in applying established design patterns to form elegant solutions to complex problems, and lean towards decoupled, clean interfaces. I use TDD where it fits, like working under Agile, and am pragmatic about methods and technologies.

<br>

I enjoy working on spatial applications, and therefore I am proficient in Python and the associated spatial stack, Postgres + PostGIS, GDAL, OpenLayers, and others.

<br>

I'm love learning and being enabled to pick the right tools for each solution.  Currently, I am taking a Java course with the expectation of passing the Oracle Certified Professional Java SE 7 exam at completion.
