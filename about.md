Software Engineer at DigitalGlobe.

### More Information

I am a polyglot developer, but I am most productive with Ruby. I use Ruby on Rails where it fits, and have had great success with the framework. I am just as comfortable with Ruby both in and outside of Rails. I have developed many applications outside of the standard Ruby web stack.

I love working on spatial applications, and therefore I am very proficient in Python and the associated spatial stack, Postgres + PostGis, GDAL, OpenLayers, and others.

I believe in using established design patterns. I lean towards decoupled, clean interfaces. I use TDD where it fits. I like working under Agile. I am not dogmatic about any methods or technologies.
