Software Engineer at DigitalGlobe.

### More Information

I am a polyglot developer most productive with Ruby and Python. I am comfortable with and without Rails and have also developed plenty of applications outside of the web stack.

<br>

I appreciate elegant solutions to complex problems through the use of software design patterns.  Simple, clean, and decoupled user and application interfaces are my preference. TDD and Agile both play a regular role in my daily work. I am pragmatic about all methods and technologies and love learning new things.

<br>

I enjoy working on spatial applications, and therefore I am proficient in Python and the associated spatial stack, Postgres + PostGIS, GDAL, OpenLayers, and others.

<br>

I'm love learning and being enabled to pick the right tools for each solution.  Currently, I am taking a Java course with the expectation of passing the Oracle Certified Professional Java SE 7 exam at completion.
