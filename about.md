Software Engineer at Tendril.

### More Information

I am a polyglot developer most productive with Python, Scala, and Java. I am very experienced with designing microservices, working with big data technologies, and designing for and implementing on AWS.
<br>

I appreciate elegant solutions to complex problems through the use of software design patterns.  Simple, clean, decoupled user and application interfaces are what I strive for. TDD and Agile both play a regular role in my work. I am pragmatic about all methods and technologies and love learning new things.

<br>

I enjoy working on geospatial applications, and therefore I am proficient in Python and the associated spatial stack, Postgres + PostGIS, GDAL, OpenLayers, and others.

This page is almost certainly out of date as my role as an R&D software engineer leads me to use the best solution at the time, so I have to learn a lot daily, and much of it involves bleeding edge tech. Please contact me for my up to date resume.
